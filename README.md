A deep learning web application that classifies **crop leaf diseases** — *Early Blight*, *Late Blight*, or *Healthy* — using **Transfer Learning with VGG16 (CNN)** trained in TensorFlow and deployed with Flask.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project assists **farmers and agricultural researchers** in identifying crop leaf diseases **quickly and accurately**.  
The VGG16-based model is trained on a **Crop Leaf Disease Dataset** (Kaggle) and integrated with a Flask web application for **real-time predictions** from uploaded images.

## 🧠 Model Details

### 📊 Dataset
**Source:** Crop Leaf Disease Dataset (Kaggle)

**Classes:**
- Early Blight  
- Late Blight  
- Healthy  

---

### 🧩 Model Architecture — VGG16 Transfer Learning
A **VGG16-based CNN** model built using TensorFlow and fine-tuned for crop disease classification.

| Parameter | Value |
|------------|--------|
| **Model Type** | Transfer Learning (VGG16 + Custom Layers) |
| **Input Image Size** | 255 × 255 × 3 |
| **Output Classes** | Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy |
| **Optimizer** | Adam |
| **Loss Function** | Sparse Categorical Crossentropy |
| **Batch Size** | 32 |
| **Epochs** | 70 (with EarlyStopping) |
| **Pre-trained Weights** | ImageNet |

## ⚙️ Flask Backend

### 🔹 Model Loading
The trained model **`Crop_Disease_Classification_VGG16.h5`** is loaded for inference.

### 🔹 Prediction Workflow
- Preprocess uploaded image
- Convert to tensor
- Run through VGG16 model
- Predict **class label** + **confidence score**

### 🔹 Flask Routes
- `'/'` → Image upload & prediction display  
- Supports: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png` formats  

---

## 🌐 Frontend (index.html)
A **Bootstrap 5 responsive interface** featuring:
- Image upload panel
- Preview of uploaded leaf image
- Predicted disease + confidence %

**Example Output:**
- Predicted Label: Early Blight  
- Confidence: 92.4%

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Support additional crops (tomato, corn, rice, etc.)
- Deploy on Render / Vercel / HuggingFace Spaces
- Integrate prediction logging database
- Add voice-based output
